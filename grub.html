	<p><strong>Embarassingly enough, I recently willy nilly deleted my ubuntu partition which left me stuck in GRUB rescue mode. Most of the tutorials I found assumed the reader had a bit more knowledge that I did, so fixing my computer took a lot of digging. Anyway, here's how to get your OS back if you're in the same boat.</p>

	<h2 class="grub_h2">Step 1: Create a bootable USB or CD of your desired OS</h2>
	<p>Here's a link to the resource I used to do this: <a class="oh" href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/</a></strong></p>

	<h2 class="grub_h2">Step 2: Plug In and Reboot </h2>
	<p><strong>Plug in your new bootable USB drive and reboot your computer</p>

	<h2 class="grub_h2">Step 3: Get out of GRUB rescue! </h2>
	<p>This was the really confusing part for me. I plugged in my bootable USB but still was unable to get out of the GRUB rescue loop when I powered down and rebooted. But... the internet was there to help. Here's what to do to get out:</p>	
	<p><strong>- When your computer reboots, press the escape key</p>
	<p>- Then type "exit" </p>
	<p>- Then hit enter and install your OS!</strong></p>
