The PRA will also feature a section outlining the legal rights a person possesses when making audio and video recordings of 3rd parties in public and private locations. The PRA will provide an easy to use interface and will offer users a robust and simple way to create and ensure the preservation of their recordings, while also supplying them with a clear overview of their legal rights.</p>
